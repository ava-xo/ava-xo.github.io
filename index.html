            <h1> INTRODUCTION
            </h1>
            Hello everyone! My name is Ava and i'm 20 and an aries . I have lived in wellington my whole life,  born and raised baby! Although, I'm hoping to move overseas in the near future. Lately Iâ€™ve been struggling with expectations of me. Feeling like I need to be a certain person for my friends, family and partner, but the biggest one being myself. So the value I've been thinking about most is self-love and learning to be content on all fronts.

        I'm attending EDA, as I really enjoy coding and IT, and it allows me to begin studying again in a completely different environment. I studied Fashion and Textiles for 2 years at Massey university and struggled with their system and learning environment ( as well as just being bored with the course in general). I felt pretty lost after dropping out as that had been my plan for so long I had forgotten what other interests I had. The last thing that I found a lot of satisfaction in was coding and my trip to silicon valley in high-school, so I decided to try that out after chatting to my flat mate who completed this course a month or so ago. I also love the idea of being able to work overseas when I do end up moving.
        I look forward to meeting everyone soon!
