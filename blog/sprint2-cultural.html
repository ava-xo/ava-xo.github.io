            <h1> MY LEARNING PLAN
            </h1>
            My long term goal and career pathway, is that i wish to work with IT and fashion at the same time, possibly a role in editing or creating websites in the fashion industry or it may turn into photography even I just plan to combine my two loves together, i also plan to do this overseas.
            I would like to develop my working skills though doing EDA, i would like to teach myself how to not get so distracted and how to get the most out of my work and the time i put into it.
            My strengths are that I’m extremely creative minded and i have a really good idea about design on lots of different levels. I have good social skills and I’m friendly and chatty. I have drive to finish my work the best i can. My limitations are for one that i have ADD so i find it extremely difficult to pay attention for long periods of time, although there are ways around that. And another is that I’m not very good with numbers, so i make sure to pay special attention to what I’m doing when i am working with numbers.
            I will make sure i go into Dev academy to do any planned work, as opposed to working from home as i know i get really distracted at home.
            Im currently pretty happy with the facilitation team, I’m finding that I’m receiving just the amount of help i need and if i needed more they would definitely be there to help me.
