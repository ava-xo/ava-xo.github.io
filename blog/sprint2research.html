            The difference between a class and an id in css is the initial character of a class selector is a full stop and an ID selector is a hash key.
            The best time to use an id when the code needs to be more ambiguous, you know exactly what that tag is being used for. If there is more than one element that needs the same or similar styles thats when you would use class selector.
