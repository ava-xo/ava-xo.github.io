            <h1> EQ and IQ
            </h1>
            EQ is emotional quotient and IQ is intelligence quotient, The difference between the two are simple. IQ is an intelligence test score, this test is designed to assess a persons cognitive ability to think and reason. The test is designed to compare your score to others in the same age and gender demographic. 

EQ is being able to identify ones own emotions. It is the level of emotional intelligence in a person. The difference between IQ and EQ in the real world is that IQ defines how smart you are in a ‘school’ or ‘work’ level but EQ is your success rate in life. 

EQ is how we act in a social setting, how we communicate and integrate ourselves with others and how we treat others in life. This is hugely important, as it is involved in how we do everything. We can be successful beings if we have a high EQ because it means that we can cope with pressures in the work place or being able to communicate whats going on in a particular situation. The difference between IQ and EQ is that you can’t really change ones IQ but you can learn how to use you’re brain and learn to manage and handle situations more effectively with EQ.
