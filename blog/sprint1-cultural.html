            <h1> IDENTITY, VALUES AND STRENGTHS
            </h1>
            I often have situations with my friends or partner that i find out information about people that used to be in their lives or even a current partner of friend and have to confront them about it. Because wellington is such a small city and i have lived here all my life i know a lot of people here and its easy to hear stuff about people you know and its hard to know whether to approach them or not.
My culture has influenced my value and identity, being brought up in nature and outside and always supplying my body with healthy organic food is something i still do as much as i can. 

My culture has influenced my values and identity, the way that i was brought up by my parents is to always be kind to everyone and to do what i want to do because the goal of life is happiness. For a while i was expected to study a certain thing but in the end all my family wants is for us all to be content. 

My strengths are that I’m extremely creative minded and i have a really good idea about design on lots of different levels. I have good social skills and I’m friendly and chatty. I have drive to finish my work the best i can. My limitations are for one that i have ADD so i find it extremely difficult to pay attention for long periods of time, although there are ways around that. And another is that I’m not very good with numbers, so i make sure to pay special attention to what I’m doing when i am working with numbers.
